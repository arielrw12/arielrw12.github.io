		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div class="me-container">
		<section class="me-info">
			<p>I am currently learning software development through We Can Code ITâ€™s boot camp in Columbus, OH. Learning and problem-solving have always been passions for me, no matter the environment, but I now get to apply them to exploring the possibilities of software. Before I pursued this passion, I received a BA in philosophy from Capital University. I also studied biology for two years before switching my major to philosophy. When I am not engaged in learning and practicing coding, I like to enjoy nature, often by hiking, camping, or kayaking in Hocking Hills, where I grew up and now live again. I also enjoy music in all forms (live, recorded, or played not-quite-impressively by me), and spend too much money going out to eat, because food is great.</p>
